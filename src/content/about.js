    `Nefedov Evgeni is a junior QA specialist trained in manual testing, 
    test documentation across STP, STD and STR, defect tracking, and the 
    fundamentals of test automation with Selenium and Java. He is also 
    developing coding skills in Python and React, and uses SQL for data 
    validation and analysis.`,

    `Evgeni is transitioning into QA after more than fifteen years in 3D 
    visualization and animation, where turning complex briefs into precise, 
    client-ready deliverables demanded rigorous attention to detail, 
    disciplined workflows, and clear communication with clients.`,

    `That background now powers his QA work: reading requirements critically, 
    designing concise and traceable test cases, reproducing defects reliably, 
    writing actionable bug reports, and collaborating smoothly with developers 
    and designers. Combining these transferable strengths with modern QA tools such as Jira, 
    Git and GitHub, plus working knowledge of HTML and CSS, he aims to help teams ship stable, 
    user-centered software with a high bar for visual and functional quality.`,
